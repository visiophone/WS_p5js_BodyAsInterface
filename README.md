Workshop "p5js Body as Interface" <br>
[Processing Community Day Porto 2024](https://pcd.fba.up.pt/2024/) <br>
<br>
The workshop explored experimental human-computer interactions using the body as an interface. Participants were introduced to the machine learning library ML5 within p5js. The workshop aproached basic examples of using hands, body, and face as interface, and then explore how the augmented body can be used as a tool for audiovisual creation. (February 2024)
<br>
The folder ["Body_As_Interface_p5jsCode"](https://github.com/visiophone/WS_p5js_BodyAsInterface/tree/main/Body_As_Interface_p5jsCode) has all the code examples explored in the workshop (Handpose, Blazepose, and Facemesh models). Found them also here: [Collections of sketches on p5js editor used on the Workshop](https://editor.p5js.org/visiophone/collections/ewYf2gJo_)
<br><br>
The examples started by "00" are the original examples from ml5 used as starting points. <br>
